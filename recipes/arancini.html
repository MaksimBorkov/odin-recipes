    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Arancini translates from Italian as "little orange", because these balls are similar to it in shape and color. If you suddenly have a large supply of boiled rice in the refrigerator, and guests are already knocking on the door, this recipe will become a lifesaver. The original version involves stuffing with minced meat, green peas, celery, carrots and onions, but you can cook a simple but delicious variation of the Italian dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>boiled round (or any other with a viscous consistency) rice or pre-cooked risotto</li>
        <li>with 1 small ball of mozzarella for each arancini</li>
        <li>flour, eggs and breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>deep-frying oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take some rice and flatten it on the palm of your hand â€” the layer should be such that the filling does not leak out during cooking.</li>
        <li>Place a ball of mozzarella in the center, cover with rice on all sides and form a ball.</li>
        <li>Roll it in flour, then in beaten egg and breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Fry in preheated oil (the balls should float in it) until the arancini turns golden.</li>
    </ol>
