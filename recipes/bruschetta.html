    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Anything can serve as a filling for bruschetta â€” toasted slices of bread, but the classic version is prepared with tomatoes.</p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 slices of bread (ideally homemade bread, such as ciabatta)</li>
        <li>1 small red onion (optional)</li>
        <li>4 plum-shaped tomatoes (you can take any; the main thing is that they have a dense pulp)</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>a little olive oil</li>
        <li>basil leaves and dried oregano optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut tomatoes into cubes, removing the seeds, add finely chopped onion to them, add salt and mix.</li>
        <li>Fry the bread on the grill, in the oven or toaster until crisp.</li>
        <li>Rub the garlic slices a little, sprinkle with olive oil and put the chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Add the torn basil leaves and lightly sprinkle with oregano (you can use a ready-made "bouquet" of Italian herbs).</li>
        <li>Serve immediately so that the bread does not have time to get wet and become soft.</li>
    </ol>
